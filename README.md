# Web3Bridge-Week7-Projects

## Voting
#### The idea behind this voting project is similar to how people choose their preferred candidate in regular elections, but in this case I restricted that only the owner of the smart contract can add voters and candidates before allowing voters to cast their ballots.

## Todo List
#### Anyone may add their list of tasks to this to-do, update the list as tasks are completed, and remove tasks from the inputted list.

## Lottery
#### A lottery smart contract that I created which allows participants to gamble a certain amount of Ether and be randomly selected, with the winner receiving 90% of the contract value and the owner receiving 10% as profit.

## Auction
#### My auction project's concept is to put an NFT up for bid, with the winning bidder being the one who offers the highest price. <br>

## Merkle Tree
#### The fundamental idea behind this merkle tree project is to make it possible to check whether a transaction is present in the tree without having to loop over each single piece. Consider a scenario where a project has adopted a whitelist method and reserved a predetermined number of tokens or NFTs for specific wallet addresses that may have been chosen through a competition, lottery, or other system. For a variety of reasons, these whitelisted addresses have been given the right to claim their reserved tokens at some point prior to the public mint. So the merkle proof here is to verify that a specific address is part of the whitelisted address.
