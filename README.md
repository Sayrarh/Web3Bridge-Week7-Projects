# Web3Bridge-Week7-Projects

## Voting
### The idea behind this voting project is similar to how people choose their preferred candidate in regular elections, but in this case I restricted that only the owner of the smart contract can add voters and candidates before allowing voters to cast their ballots.

## Todo List
### Anyone may add their list of tasks to this to-do, update the list as tasks are completed, and remove tasks from the inputted list.

## Lottery
### A lottery smart contract that I created which allows participants to gamble a certain amount of Ether and <br> be randomly selected, with the winner receiving 90% of the contract value and the owner receiving 10% as profit.

## Auction
### My auction project's concept is to put an NFT up for bid, with the winning bidder being the one who offers the highest price. <br>
